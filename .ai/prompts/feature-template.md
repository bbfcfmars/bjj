# Feature prompt

Implement a feature using **.ai/context/** as the source of truth.

- Read `current-state.md`, `conventions.md`, and `dependencies.md` as needed.
- Follow folder and naming rules in `conventions.md`.
- Log any new architecture or product choices in `decisions.md`.
- For BJJ-specific behavior, align with README and .cursorrules content in `_notes/bjj-starter.md`.

Describe the feature and any constraints (e.g. “must not break when JSON is missing for a video”).
