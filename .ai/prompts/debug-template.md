# Debug prompt

Debug using:

1. **Repro steps** — Exact actions (e.g. which clip, which page, which click).
2. **Logs / errors** — Terminal, browser console, or build output.
3. **Expected vs actual** — What should happen vs what happens.

Point to the relevant file or component if known. If the issue is agent output (wrong technique, bad timestamps), note the video id and JSON path.
