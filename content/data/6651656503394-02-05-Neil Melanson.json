  "description": "This technique demonstrates a no-gi armbar setup that transitions from a pendulum sweep attempt. The key is to first get the opponent off balance with the sweep motion before fully committing to the armbar, ensuring higher success and better control from the top position. The practitioner emphasizes curling the heels for increased breaking pressure.",
