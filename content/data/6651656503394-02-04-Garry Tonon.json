  "portuguese_name": "Calcanhar Invertido",
  "description": "The inverted heel hook is a powerful leg lock that attacks the knee joint by applying rotational force to the heel. It's often performed from leg entanglements like cross ashi garami, requiring precise hand placement and hip leverage for effective breaking pressure.",
