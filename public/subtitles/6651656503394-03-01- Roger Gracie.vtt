Okay, guys. So now let's work the cross collar choke from the mount.

00:14.330 --> 00:15.350
So it's

00:15.350 --> 00:20.900
there's a lot of small details that's very important for you to follow because,

00:20.900 --> 00:24.470
you know, without them, you attack will fall apart and you will fail.

00:24.470 --> 00:30.930
It's, you know, focus on the details and every details are very, very important.

00:30.930 --> 00:36.560
Small things together, they make the attack very efficient.

00:36.560 --> 00:43.140
It's, you know, if you miss a few, it's you won't hold your attack, you will collapse.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.200
So it's, you know, pay attention, like,

00:44.200 --> 00:54.670
putting the hand deep is, you know, how deep do you go, like, spend some time, how you, you know, you have to react when you put your hand deep in the collar because it weakens your position.

00:54.670 --> 01:00.730
You cannot be leaning forward too much because when he bridges, he gets you out.

01:00.730 --> 01:15.700
Because the cross collar choke from the mount is probably the most challenging attack to do because your hands are busy, you cannot use your hands on the floor to stop the person escaping.

01:15.700 --> 01:28.910
That's why it's so difficult to master the cross collar choke in the mount, if you're attacking the arm lock, the person is bridging, he's trying to escape, I'm sitting up, my arms are free, I can use the floor to stop if I have to.

01:28.910 --> 01:36.310
In the cross collar choke in the mount, if I have to use my hands on the floor to stop, I automatically need to stop my attack, and he kind of gains some more space.

01:36.310 --> 01:43.510
So, it's very important is to establish a good control first, then you go for the attack.

01:43.510 --> 01:57.670
It's, you feel, you feel controlling the mount is not secure, if you don't feel confidence, you will fail, that's the biggest challenge in the cross collar choke to finish.

01:57.670 --> 02:04.530
Is securing the mount as you're trying to attack without having to use your hands on the floor.

02:04.530 --> 02:17.380
So, first, we did a video before when the person is replacing God, how to prevent that.

02:17.380 --> 02:26.500
So, we, we came through that.

02:26.500 --> 02:37.490
Now, how to stop him bridging, that's very important, especially now that I'm going to start going for the neck.

02:37.490 --> 02:48.330
We already know that the first thing the person needs to bridge is to get control of my arm, then he will bridge over and then he gets me out.

02:48.330 --> 02:52.270
So, for the, for the bridge, he needs to

02:52.270 --> 03:07.410
He needs to grab my arm first, then he goes, when he grabs my arm, is exactly the same, when I reach the collar, I'm giving him the arm.

03:07.410 --> 03:14.390
By grabbing the collar, I'm giving him the arm for him now he can try to bridge, but I still need to maintain the mount and attack.

03:14.390 --> 03:18.060
Go for the finish.

03:18.060 --> 03:22.300
So, that means his arm is locked, I cannot allow myself for when he bridges,

03:22.300 --> 03:30.980
for me to do that to stop the mount, that cannot happen.

03:30.980 --> 03:36.750
So, how do I maintain the mount holding his column?

03:36.750 --> 03:41.340
So, how to get there?

03:41.340 --> 03:49.270
So, on the other videos we did, we already know that as we reach in the high mount, we secure the elbows and we lean back, right?

03:49.270 --> 03:57.440
It's, if my head is past 90 degrees, and if you try to bridge, start by your gun, it's

03:57.440 --> 04:02.040
See, I'm just go higher, very rarely he's going to get me to the floor.

04:02.040 --> 04:06.630
I push my head forward, if he bridges now, I'm falling, right?

04:06.630 --> 04:14.940
So, one thing that I cannot do is stay halfway, here he bridges, I need my hand.

04:14.940 --> 04:21.960
I can only stay on this position as long as my arms are free because I already know that I don't need to stop that, stop the fall.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.540
If I lean back, I don't, or I go all the way down.

04:26.540 --> 04:36.310
Now he tried to bridge it, not right down.

04:36.310 --> 04:41.670
See, he cannot move me because I'm not sitting on him anymore.

04:41.670 --> 04:46.330
My feet, never leave his body, remember that, and my head on the floor, it works as a hand.

04:46.330 --> 04:56.240
So, to secure the mount, either I'm going to be very far back, or I'm going to be completely over him.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.670
So, now reach in the column, so there's different ways that you can go with the first hand.

05:00.670 --> 05:14.880
One thing for you to, to be aware, most of the times that I get my hand into his column is when I see a gap there.

05:14.880 --> 05:22.000
If I see a gap, the hand goes in, very rarely the person is this time.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.830
He can be there, but then he's not trying to escape because he's working about defense, so I don't have to worry too much about him escaping.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.450
And then I can focus and get the arm in.

05:33.450 --> 05:37.340
But the moment that he bridges, then he goes away, on the hand on the floor, boom.

05:37.340 --> 05:41.010
The hand goes in quick before he expects.

05:41.010 --> 05:44.200
Let's suppose he's keeping very tight, not giving me anything.

05:44.200 --> 05:53.600
I always like to go under his arm, so I push him because it doesn't matter how tight he, he gets.

05:53.600 --> 05:59.070
It's, you know, you can always work is a, just a little.

05:59.070 --> 06:04.990
The hand goes in, all I need to do is lift the arm up a little bit.

06:04.990 --> 06:12.780
So I, I take the pressure off and I put the hand in.

06:12.780 --> 06:20.570
So it doesn't matter how tight he gets, look, he can defend, my arm goes in.

06:20.570 --> 06:24.470
So I push, I go through here.

06:24.470 --> 06:30.930
If I try, if I try to go through the hand, this is very tight, see, there's already a gap there.

06:30.930 --> 06:33.910
So I don't go towards the hand.

06:33.910 --> 06:40.400
I just want my arm through, doesn't matter if he's still defending, if I cannot grab the call.

06:40.400 --> 06:46.330
So, the first stage is my hand goes through.

06:46.330 --> 06:50.040
Now I'm in dangerous for the bridge.

06:50.040 --> 06:59.200
Straight away my body comes this side, see, I'm already leaning in where my arm is free, because he can bridge this way and I can stop.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.110
If he bridges that way, it's harder, and if he really goes, he gives me the arm.

07:03.110 --> 07:06.310
Because he will turn, he will not take me.

07:06.310 --> 07:11.960
Now his arm is exposed.

07:11.960 --> 07:16.480
So, when I lean this way, he has to be very careful going that way, because he will expose his arm.

07:16.480 --> 07:22.000
So let's say the, now he's defending, I like to grab inside the wrist.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.040
I pull, and then I place my hand.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.610
Then I grab, I adjust, pull, get the hand tight.

07:29.610 --> 07:32.420
Now I like to sit slightly back.

07:32.420 --> 07:40.090
I don't like to put the cross collar to stay in a, in a very high mount, see my forearm can barely touch his chest.

07:40.090 --> 07:45.320
So, I need to be lower for me to be able to do that.

07:45.320 --> 07:54.670
I press my forearm against his body, the moment that my hand is there, my elbow will aim.

07:54.670 --> 07:58.210
So, first, my wrist will straight.

07:58.210 --> 08:08.570
So, when I stretch my wrist and I press my elbow down, I'm already starting to put pressure into his neck, not enough to tap, of course, it's just one hand, but he's uncomfortable.

08:08.570 --> 08:14.370
I'm pressing the side of his neck already, he's not in a comfortable position, so that means he will struggle more to escape.

08:14.370 --> 08:19.460
Push it down for sure.

08:19.460 --> 08:24.490
So, the moment that I grab, remember, this arm is free, before I go for the other side.

08:24.490 --> 08:27.700
I want this grip as deep as I can.

08:27.700 --> 08:31.950
The first hand is very important that I go really deep.

08:31.950 --> 08:36.750
Because this one is free, so I have two hands to adjust one grip.

08:36.750 --> 08:44.200
After I have that grip, now I have one hand to adjust one grip, so this grip will never be as tight as this.

08:44.200 --> 08:50.000
So, the first grip is as tight as I can, because he will go deeper.

08:50.000 --> 08:58.420
Now, the second one does not need to go so deep, if this is not so deep, that one has to go super deep, otherwise the, the choke will be weak.

08:58.420 --> 09:02.140
So, but it's harder, the second hand will never be as deep as the first ever.

09:02.140 --> 09:06.580
Because it's not possible, because I, I don't have any help with the second grip, the first one I have two hands.

09:06.580 --> 09:12.180
So, this has to be deeper, has to, the other hand is helping, take your time, lean that way, look, he's defending, pull, slide, slide in.

09:12.180 --> 09:16.890
The moment that I adjust my grip, elbow down, straight away, hand above his head.

09:16.890 --> 09:22.090
Because again, it's about control, if you try to bridge now.

09:22.090 --> 09:27.870
He cannot bridge, see, that hand stops, worst case scenario, my head goes on the floor, now he goes up.

09:27.870 --> 09:39.990
Here, look, bridge, even with no hands, push it up for sure, not like that.

09:39.990 --> 09:43.760
Look, I don't need hands to block the mount.

09:43.760 --> 09:47.010
So, that mean my arms are free to choke him.

09:47.010 --> 09:51.690
The moment that I get the first hand in, elbow down, hand on the floor.

09:51.690 --> 09:56.550
Because if you try to bridge, I'm pushing myself back, look, no chance.

09:56.550 --> 10:01.810
Now, when I feel secure, I'm going to replace my hand by my elbow.

10:01.810 --> 10:06.840
See, my elbow's, this is still helping me, if you try to bridge, my forehead can touch the floor.

10:06.840 --> 10:11.830
Now, the moment that I get to this position, he knows

10:11.830 --> 10:17.370
I'm very close to finish, he will do everything he can to defend the second grip.

10:17.370 --> 10:23.750
So, the, the head goes close to the, the shoulder, the shoulder comes up, both hands goes in.

10:23.750 --> 10:29.800
He will close that gap to give me nothing.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.430
So, ideally he go both hands in.

10:33.430 --> 10:36.570
And the head and the shoulder, everything tight.

10:36.570 --> 10:42.500
Because now, look, it's very difficult to get through both hands, it's not easy.

10:42.500 --> 10:48.970
That's why I find four fingers in, the harder grip to get.

10:48.970 --> 10:52.480
So, I, it's hard to go this way.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.700
So, I go on the elbow, I go behind, look, thumb behind the ear.

10:56.700 --> 11:00.670
It's very difficult for him to defend that, even if he close everything.

11:00.670 --> 11:06.490
Look, I go behind the ear, I loosen up the ghee first.

11:06.490 --> 11:10.590
Loosen up, get him loose, doesn't matter if he bridges, if he bridges, I'm defending.

11:10.590 --> 11:16.890
I can stay here, I'm comfortable.

11:16.890 --> 11:21.800
Now I'm going to solid grip, you're going to place his palm into his face to defend the grip.

11:21.800 --> 11:26.540
Now I'm going to keep my arm tight into his head and I'm going to turn.

11:26.540 --> 11:32.410
And finish.

11:32.410 --> 11:38.380
When he places the hand, they all do, they do this to defend.

11:38.380 --> 11:42.060
So, the first hand I in, I go into his call.

11:42.060 --> 11:46.330
I'm going to let go just for you guys to see, what you don't want is to rotate over.

11:46.330 --> 11:50.040
Because now he blocks, I'm going to get my wrist bone.

11:50.040 --> 11:53.640
I need to get just the top of his finger.

11:53.640 --> 12:00.620
So, I'm going to place look, on the top, and now I slide down to remove it.

12:00.620 --> 12:05.150
Just, you know, you do scratch his face but without hurting your opponent.

12:05.150 --> 12:12.720
The idea is not to, you know, to, to scratch his whole face that you're not supposed to hurt anyone.

12:12.720 --> 12:20.150
But you need to keep it tight enough so you bend his fingers and you get it through.

12:20.150 --> 12:25.590
Just enough to get through, there so you place your wrist, they'll be on the side.

12:25.590 --> 12:30.980
Above, go right on top of the fingers and just slide in, and then you get it through, very important.

12:30.980 --> 12:38.450
Everyone will do this to defend, that's why you go behind, look, you go behind his defense.

12:38.450 --> 12:44.200
So, the first hands are in, remember, my elbow is being squeezed against his chest.

12:44.200 --> 12:50.400
He's already feel uncomfortable on this position, elbow, adjust, see his hand, slide look, and then drop down straight away.
