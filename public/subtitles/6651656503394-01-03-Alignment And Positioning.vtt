NORTH SOUTH CHOKE - ALIGNMENT AND POSITIONING
MARCELO GARCIA

00:05.180 --> 00:06.010
Oh, I don't thank you guys.

00:06.010 --> 00:09.110
Um, I have the side control.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.780
I was able to get the person's hands out of the way.

00:13.180 --> 00:23.770
And I get over here, I, look, it's, it's almost like you take a shot and then you hit the shot, you know you cut the person's neck open, you're good to go, so you need to just organize to do everything right.

00:24.080 --> 00:35.390
But then sometimes people get over here and the person's not moving, but then the other person start moving on top like too much.

00:35.790 --> 00:46.060
I don't know if you guys can see it, but if I go too far, all my pressure is going to one side of his head and not against his neck, so I'm, I'm taking the pressure like away from the, from the, from the position.

00:46.060 --> 00:59.080
So once I got over here, once I feel like my shoulder is aligned with with his shoulder, I don't want to get drive and push more.

00:59.080 --> 10:04.980
I have to make sure like my head is going straight like towards his feet and I, I'm staying lined up with him.

10:05.510 --> 10:14.390
And if I shift my hip a little bit, I tend to start losing my balance if he move, I get off of balance.

10:14.390 --> 10:20.180
So I, I'm going to lose the position too. So the most important.

10:20.180 --> 10:27.460
As, as a, a base over here is to have my body aligned with him.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.980
So my body is aligned so I don't fall.

10:30.980 --> 10:37.490
My body's alignment, so I make sure all the pressure goes against his neck.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.890
I have the other hand connect.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.840
I start doing the squeeze.

10:43.020 --> 10:49.070
I stay aligned with his body and my feet stay on the ground.

10:49.070 --> 10:53.680
Not my knee. I'm not putting just my knee, I'm just pulling like my toes on the ground, just to stay in the position.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.120
And then I'm.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.670
I'm putting a constant pressure.

11:00.860 --> 11:10.050
I'm not doing like 100% I'm like, oh my arm's tired and taking a little bit of pressure, I'm putting 100% and my arm's getting tired or a little bit.

11:10.050 --> 11:15.580
Less pressure, I'm keeping like a steady pressure.

11:15.580 --> 11:18.420
I find align.

11:18.890 --> 11:23.770
I get my shoulder pressure against against his neck.

11:23.950 --> 11:27.020
I keep everything tight.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.070
And just just squeeze.

11:29.070 --> 11:34.930
If I start like putting pressure and take it out, every time I take it out, I feel like he take a a deep breath again.

11:34.930 --> 11:42.300
So I have to keep a a slow pressure, but constant pressure and I, I trust on that pressure because I know his head is in place.

11:42.660 --> 11:46.540
So, I was able to get here.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.600
Keep his head locked and just keep the pressure.

11:50.050 --> 11:54.490
Then I don't need to take much, I just cannot lose the position.

11:54.490 --> 12:00.370
And usually people lose the position because they start to adjust the position, they start to like move.

12:00.370 --> 12:03.950
They start to bend and then they lose the position and they end up on the back.

12:04.280 --> 12:12.780
So, all I'm doing, I lean over here, I know I'm aligned with with his legs.

12:13.060 --> 12:18.900
Now what I have to do is just to keep my feet a little bit wide.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.080
If I put my feet together.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.080
I'm going to roll.

12:21.080 --> 12:25.790
So I don't want to roll, I'm just going to keep my leg kind of like slightly spread out.

12:25.920 --> 12:28.160
It's not completely spread out, just slight spread out.

12:28.160 --> 12:32.400
And my feet post because once he bump, my feet has to pull.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.430
If he bumps the other way, my feet has to pull and then I have the position.

12:35.430 --> 12:36.600
So foot.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.400
And guys.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.400
You see someone is that control.

12:41.130 --> 12:47.380
When I'm teaching and I see my students drilling, I go, look, I find they're doing the move and the person's head is, is like this.

12:48.430 --> 12:51.640
They almost felt like the, the person's head like is close to their shoulder.

12:51.640 --> 12:57.900
So you just have to do the same choke with the same squeeze with your body line up with his body.

12:58.240 --> 13:00.410
One more time.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.160
And if you're not sure.

13:02.160 --> 13:07.720
You just have to work and practice so we can have that sense of like, oh I'm going too far.

13:07.720 --> 13:13.500
If my feet start walking too much, look, I can see, I can see the line of his leg.

13:13.680 --> 13:18.330
If my feet start passing towards the line, means like I'm, I'm change, I'm change the posture of his body.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.190
And so his head is not going to be straight.

13:20.190 --> 13:24.430
So I clean up his hand, I drop the other hand, I go, and squeeze, drop, and suck.

13:25.290 --> 13:27.970
This hand, like I said.

13:28.090 --> 13:32.060
If I take too long to connect, I'm going to lose the choke because he's going to break up.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.420
So this thing has to be quick to kick in.

13:34.790 --> 13:37.620
As I'm get over here, I just drop my shoulder.

13:37.810 --> 13:42.500
My feet is still on the ground and I just maintain like a steady squeeze.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.760
Steady squeeze because.

13:45.300 --> 13:47.450
That should be.

13:47.450 --> 13:50.930
That should be the type of squeeze that can last long.

13:51.950 --> 13:53.300
I feel.

13:54.210 --> 13:54.600
I, I never come.

13:55.070 --> 14:02.950
But I feel when I do the choke, I do the type of squeeze that I feel like I can hold maybe two minutes that choke.

14:02.950 --> 14:06.590
I can hold the choke like a.

14:06.770 --> 14:14.930
I'm, I'm not going 100%, I'm going like a 6%, maybe 7% if the person is really tough, but most like I, I'm just like I feel I can hold maybe two minutes on that choke.

14:14.930 --> 14:24.780
I don't think if you have if I have a perfect choke, I don't think nobody really last that long because it's like a choke, like you have your head under the water, you're not breathing, but like, you, you got, you got to have the other person like that.

14:25.070 --> 14:28.230
Getting choked, if you just keep a steady steady pressure.

14:28.790 --> 14:32.840
And then obviously like, that's what, that's what you want, you want to make the other person tap from there.

14:32.840 --> 14:36.460
But first, you have to make sure you have your body aligned with his body.
