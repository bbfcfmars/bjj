00:00.000 --> 00:05.100
Now we're going to add an arm bar to that.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.120
Same sweep sequence that we just did.

00:07.120 --> 00:16.880
As far as using the scissor leg position or scissor hack position

00:16.880 --> 00:20.500
to to the pendulum.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.400
When you're doing this, going for the arm bar here,

00:24.400 --> 00:30.980
the one thing you have to, in my opinion, you need to do,

00:30.980 --> 00:34.900
unless you're going to take a pit stop and go to a corner lock.

00:34.900 --> 00:38.280
Which works, um, fabulous.

00:38.280 --> 00:44.820
You want to get him moving in the sweep first.

00:44.820 --> 00:54.670
Remember, like, if you're going to hit an arm bar, you do not want him to be able to time the arm pulling out.

00:54.670 --> 01:00.670
Or go to some defense and pick you up and slam you kind of thing.

01:00.670 --> 01:08.510
So, what you really want is you want to get that body moving forward where once he's off balance, the defense is shit.

01:08.510 --> 01:14.640
So, don't be in a hurry to get the leg around the head.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.460
There's a, yeah, don't be in a hurry to get to that arm bar.

01:19.460 --> 01:24.590
Instead, just focus on getting him forward into the sweep.

01:24.590 --> 01:29.800
You can actually hit the arm bar once you sweep him if you really want to.

01:29.800 --> 01:35.320
But you're better off doing something like that,

01:35.320 --> 01:46.600
than to hit the arm bar here and go for it directly, you, um, create that body moving forward.

01:46.600 --> 01:50.810
Get it off balance and, uh, you'll be able to land a higher percentage arm bar.

01:50.810 --> 02:02.810
And, plus, if you're if he goes to a defensive position, um, you want to be on top breaking that grip and and countering his counter of the arm bar.

02:02.810 --> 02:04.750
You don't want to be on your back.

02:04.750 --> 02:24.770
Okay? Just in No-Gi, I don't recommend it. You have a higher percent of chance of finishing that arm bar if you're trying to finish it and, um, from from being on top in, like, what they call the spiderweb position now.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.770
So, your your percentage rate is going to be a lot higher to finish.

02:27.770 --> 02:30.400
So, what you want to try to do is get that that sweep going.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.200
Okay? I'll probably have to hit a couple angles of this, but

02:34.200 --> 02:38.830
So, I'm here, I create my space, I couldn't fake for the sweep or whatever the case is.

02:38.830 --> 02:42.500
But now I'm starting to let him in.

02:42.500 --> 02:46.850
Now, when I go for this hook, you see, I'm kind of in a cape position.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.330
Okay?

02:48.330 --> 02:53.300
And now I'm going to start letting him in and getting that body moving forward.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.600
And then I'll time the the arm bar.

02:54.600 --> 03:07.410
So, as I go here, I'm going to let go, get that body moving, and come over the top.

03:07.410 --> 03:08.000
Okay?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.970
I had to do that slow.

03:10.970 --> 03:12.780
And I'll, I'll discuss how I do my legs here in a second.

03:12.780 --> 03:14.390
Okay?

03:14.390 --> 03:17.380
One more time.

03:17.380 --> 03:22.460
Okay, so I'm here.

03:22.460 --> 03:25.560
Try to pull the hack.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.260
Nope.

03:27.260 --> 03:29.830
And now here.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.400
Okay? Now,

03:32.400 --> 03:33.200
One time.

03:33.200 --> 03:41.340
Everybody, a lot of people have different philosophies about the, uh, where your leg is.

03:41.340 --> 03:42.920
Leg, you know, crossed,

03:42.920 --> 03:49.030
uncrossed, everybody's got their own little their thing.

03:49.030 --> 03:55.770
I used to not cross my ankles when I first started because I learned certain someone like that.

03:55.770 --> 04:06.670
But in my experience, I cross my ankles.

04:06.670 --> 04:14.070
I I cross my ankles all the fucking time and part of that reason is I'm trying to capture his, um, his shoulder.

04:14.070 --> 04:20.970
And it prevents some of the escapes from when he's on his back.

04:20.970 --> 04:35.340
Okay? But the other thing is when you curl your heels, you can break the arm bar, break his arm, not necessarily by pulling the hand back, by pulling the the the upper part of the arm forward.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.370
Okay? So, uh, good example.

04:37.370 --> 04:38.290
Can you lay here?

04:38.290 --> 04:39.110
Yeah.

04:39.110 --> 04:40.400
Just go on your back.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.200
Like I have an arm bar.

04:42.200 --> 04:42.950
Okay?

04:42.950 --> 04:45.300
So, Okay.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.000
So, let's say, all right, let's say I'm here, okay?

04:50.000 --> 04:52.400
Just, like, keep your arm straight.

04:52.400 --> 04:58.700
Okay? So, if I'm here, right now, my legs aren't doing anything.

04:58.700 --> 05:01.070
Okay? So, his arm is not moving, right?

05:01.070 --> 05:03.110
But now I'm going to curl.

05:03.110 --> 05:04.430
You see how his leg went up?

05:04.430 --> 05:05.410
His arm went up, I mean.

05:05.410 --> 05:14.730
So, basically, by curling, I move this part of the arm forward, okay?

05:14.730 --> 05:18.060
By doing that, if I have this arm here, pinned to my chest.

05:18.060 --> 05:22.310
Let's say I have it pinned to my chest, and now, instead of pulling the arm bar,

05:22.310 --> 05:29.800
I just start curling, it's going to take very little for me to have to break the arm as far as driving through it.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.960
You see what I'm saying? So,

05:32.960 --> 06:11.830
don't always feel like, uh, oh, I got to keep my legs open, and then do all this other stuff, you know?

06:11.830 --> 06:16.800
I my my recommendation is, especially if he's he's you get him locked up behind his shoulder.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.460
You're going to have better luck breaking the arm with

06:19.460 --> 06:26.500
a curling the legs and then there's my legs are a little long for this, but one of the options you can do is, you don't want someone to

06:26.500 --> 06:33.250
when you're here trying to break the grip or doing the arm bar, you don't want him to split your legs apart.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.310
And you don't want him to sit up and get back on top to stack you.

06:35.310 --> 06:40.850
When you pull your legs apart, you your knee press it down on the body, and the other knee presses down on the head.

06:40.850 --> 06:46.300
So, it makes it a lot harder for him to roll his body to sit up and counter you.

06:46.300 --> 06:50.000
If my knees are together more, he's he can pick his head up,

06:50.000 --> 06:55.400
and he can also get his hips up high, okay?

06:55.400 --> 07:00.670
And by doing that, he's going to find a way to destabilize me and try to counter the the arm bar.

07:00.670 --> 07:06.000
So, when you do this, my recommendation is to curl and to spread a little.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.110
My legs are super long, so,

07:09.110 --> 07:18.720
I'm gonna go with heavyweights, I can spread and it works great.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.420
When I go with people smaller, I kind of don't spread as much as I want to.

07:22.420 --> 07:30.930
Just because my legs are so long that, uh, well, what can happen, I can open up a hole for the head to slip through if I'm not careful.

07:30.930 --> 07:31.950
That's why probably people don't want to do that.

07:31.950 --> 07:38.200
But when you're my legs are very long, but when I do it with the heavyweights, I'm a heavyweight, so my own weight class, it's no problem.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.800
205 is no problem.

07:40.800 --> 07:44.200
You start getting lighter, you know, these guys are so small.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.450
They're going to, I got, you know, it's, uh, it's a little more tricky.

07:47.450 --> 07:53.300
You know, so, I definitely recommend you, you figure this out.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.500
I learned this a long time ago, and it was great advice.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.750
And, and, uh, I still think it's a better fundamental

07:58.750 --> 08:04.900
than naturally being, like, here, um, where, yeah, your feet can move and all that stuff.

08:04.900 --> 08:09.280
But I I see he can counter way more often.

08:09.280 --> 08:14.330
Then if both arms are locked like this, okay?

08:14.330 --> 08:26.540
So, boom, look for your sweep, doesn't happen, whatever the case is.

08:26.540 --> 08:33.720
Now, switch, get that body going forward, hit your pendulum, I go here, I have a good bite.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.700
I keep the leg and I keep the hand.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.500
So, I have two-on-one this and here.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.760
And now I lock, curl.

08:43.760 --> 08:48.330
See how he taps?

08:48.330 --> 08:50.040
Just curling my legs is doing the break.

08:50.040 --> 08:56.880
Not even the fact that I'm gonna pull and drive my hips forward.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.670
You can do these kind of locks, you're really driving your hips, uh, through the arm.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.040
And here's the other thing.

09:02.040 --> 09:08.570
If you If you pull, let's say you do poor technique,

09:08.570 --> 09:12.700
and you're not able to break the arm.

09:12.700 --> 09:16.890
But maybe you get taps in training.

09:16.890 --> 09:27.700
Those those taps are or people that just, they just don't care.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.980
They're just, they're going to throw it away.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.400
I don't care.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.400
Okay?

09:32.400 --> 09:38.220
If a guy can't break your limb, and he's my training partner, I'm going to push it.

09:38.220 --> 09:44.200
I'm going to fight like hell because he needs to learn.

09:44.200 --> 09:50.800
If you can't break it, not that I want him to break my arm.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.480
If I feel like he can break it, I'm going to tap.

09:52.480 --> 09:57.240
But most people lose sight of these techniques,

09:57.240 --> 10:04.090
and how, hey, that's supposed to break the arm.

10:04.090 --> 10:06.120
Well, there's plenty of guys I know that do arm bars.

10:06.120 --> 10:11.230
They get the arm straight, and it's scary looking, but they can't fucking break it.

10:11.230 --> 10:12.720
If you can't break it, it's not real.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.110
That's just my perspective, you know?

10:15.110 --> 10:22.390
If you go for a knee bar, and guys tap, but you can't break that knee.

10:22.390 --> 10:24.400
What are you doing?

10:24.400 --> 10:28.840
It's just, it concession holds, um,

10:28.840 --> 10:39.950
are so common, you know, because of training, no one wants to get hurt, but it it can

10:39.950 --> 10:48.000
you just don't want to give a concession tap, or concession hold, more credit than a true lock that can break the limb.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.140
And, you know,

10:50.140 --> 10:55.430
this is supposed to be about, you know, real fighting on the street originally.

10:55.430 --> 10:59.390
You know, uh, what do you think's going to happen if you can't break his arm?

10:59.390 --> 11:00.640
You know?

11:00.640 --> 11:04.030
He's not going to tap in a street fight.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.180
You got to be able to break it.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.900
And that's that's when it comes to arm bars,

11:06.900 --> 11:10.020
especially, I don't, uh, make sure

11:10.020 --> 11:15.800
you're not doing piss poor technique on your arm bar, he he you should feel the tightness of the arm lock straight

11:15.800 --> 11:23.700
without you having to lean back much at all to drive your hips in to break it.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.700
You know, you want to feel bunched up with his arm straight.

11:26.700 --> 11:32.480
So, a simple slight motion gives you a lot of room.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.320
You have, you have so much room to break through that that arm.

11:35.320 --> 11:39.770
So, it's, uh, it's a very important thing that,

11:39.770 --> 11:46.770
you know, it's okay to criticize someone's technique if you don't think they can break it.

11:46.770 --> 11:51.570
You know, and just make sure you do it right.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.940
And how I like to do it is I like to cross,

11:53.940 --> 11:59.500
capture the far shoulder, pull it in, that moves the arm forward up and high.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.130
Meanwhile, I'm locking it low.

12:02.130 --> 12:05.500
And then as that happens, I can just drive my hips through it.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.820
And I can break the arm.

12:07.820 --> 12:12.700
You know, some people can't do shit like that unless they're wearing a cup or whatever.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.390
So, just make sure you can break it.

12:14.390 --> 12:17.390
Because if you can't break it, it's it's fucking worthless.

12:17.390 --> 12:20.000
It really is.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.050
You might get away with it in the gym, but,

12:21.050 --> 12:26.240
you're going to learn the hard way eventually.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.340
So,

12:27.340 --> 12:28.460
just put some thought into that.
