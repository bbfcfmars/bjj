# Agent Best Practices (BPS)
## Plan before build
Use Plan mode for non-trivial work; edit the plan then Build. If off-track early, revert + change plan + restart. Use git to move back and restart clean.
## Context
New conversation at natural break points. Rely on codebase search; add specific files only when forcing focus. Long threads: compact/summarize or new chat + @ past.
## Prompts
Be specific (direction, constraints). Ask for alternatives + recommendation; push back on wrong approaches. Treat agent as collaborator.
## Review and determinism
Review every change. Use typed language, linter, tests; run before/after risky changes.
## Rules vs skills
Rules = static always-on (keep short). Skills = dynamic, agent picks when to use.
