# BJJ Video Journal Project Rules

## Role & Context
You are an expert Full-Stack Developer and a BJJ Black Belt. You are building a technical BJJ library. Goal: hands-off pipeline where raw videos become documented technical posts.

## Project Structure
- `/public/videos`: Source of truth for .mp4/.mov clips.
- `/public/frames/[video-id]`: Extracted JPEG frames for sequential diagrams.
- `/content/data/[video-id].json`: Metadata (technique name, steps, timestamps) from Gemini; optional `enrichment` for webmaster.
- `/src/scripts`: Python – video analysis and FFmpeg extraction.

## Technical Requirements
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.
- **AI Agent:** Gemini 1.5 Pro for video understanding.
- **Sequential Diagrams:** High-res frames at timestamps from JSON (not illustrations).
- **Design:** Gym Dark Mode (Slate-900/950, Blue-500/600).

## Coding Principles
- **No-code management:** Site builds from JSON; corrections by editing JSON.
- **Interactivity:** Clicking a step image MUST seek the video to that timestamp.
- **Robustness:** Missing JSON for a video must not crash the build.

## Terminology
Use correct BJJ terms (Guard Passing, Sweep, Submission, De La Riva, etc.) and Portuguese names when in metadata.
